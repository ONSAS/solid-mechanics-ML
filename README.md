# mamaML
First tests in automating a pipeline for generating automatically a database of FEM solutions to unidimensional compression/extension problem, and learning with a Neural Network to solve same mechanical problem.

### 1.02.22

- We discussed different methods and algorithms that can be used to simulate structures.
- Leo and Mauricio present some minor scripting results on uniaxial compression example.
- Bruno shared some reference denoting a skepticism on the ability of ML models to generalize well. 
- We decided to generate 1000 samples changing E, Lx, p and to predict the value of $u_x$ at $x$ = [ $L_x$ , $0$ , $0$ ]
